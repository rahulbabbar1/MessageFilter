# MessageFilter
An android app that claasifies SMSs on different categories like
* Personal
* Spam
* Social
* OTP

using machine learning, natural language processing

Future Prospects

We aim to move the classification process to the android app itself, so that no internet would be required for classifying the messages.

More features to be provided like sms scheduler, alerts, sms using internet, cloud sms backup, read receipts using internet. 

Relevant data from specific messages like those containing reservation details (Railway, Flight, Hotel etc.), debit/credit alerts, item delivery etc., to be extracted and displayed on a more user friendly UI/UX.
